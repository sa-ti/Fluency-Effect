# Fluency-Effect

Fluency - the perceived Easiness with which information are being processed - is a well-known phenomenon and plays a big role when making decisions and assessments. A high fluency can lead to positive judgment. Also with web pages, the fluency effect could have an influence. That's why we wanted to find out whether through manipulation of visual complexity of static websites the fluency effect can also be evoked thus making the websites more trustworthy, aesthetically and familiar. For this, we recreated websites from different areas and manipulated them in terms of typography, symmetry and contrast. In one condition (combination) all manipulations were combined. 

The manipulated websites for the category "lawyers" can be found in the folders.

To test, if the original websites would receive a better judgment than the manipulated ones, we conducted a study with 120 participants. The procedure was coded using Inquisit. 

The results showed that the manipulations of typography, symmetry and contrast increase the visual complexity. However, due to the change of visual complexity no influence of the fluency effect on the judgment of the subjects could be determined.
